This document presents other projects that provide similar or complementary
functionalities. It focuses on differences with `transmutator`.

Very short: `transmutator` tries to fill a gap in deployment stack:

* Provisioners such as `Puppet`, `Chef` or `Salt` are fine to describe states.
  But they doesn't always fit for upgrades, cleanup or downgrades.

* Frameworks such as `Django` have their own database migration tools. But
  migrations are not just a matter of databases, and can involve orchestration
  between several components in the stack (i.e. not limited to `Django`).
